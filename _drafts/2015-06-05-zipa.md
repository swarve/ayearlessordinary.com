Just 30 minutes ouside of Bogotá in Colombia is the town of Zipaquirá, known for its salt mine within a hill next to the town. These mines were originally begun by the pre-Columbian Muisca people in the **5th century BC**. 

The hill has been continually mined since then, and in 1991 a new cathedral was begun to be carved out inside the mine.
