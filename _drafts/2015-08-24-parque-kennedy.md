Kennedy Park in Lima is a beautiful, well manicured and maintained park in the middle of Miraflores, a bustling and trendy suburb in Lima. It's easy to get to with public transport options surrounding it, endless restaurants and cafes, and even has free Wi-Fi. But what is so unique about this park is the cats. A park full of around 100 cats that happily live here in the middle of the city.

It's not known how the cat's became to be in the park, but theres lots of stories or tales of how it all began. Cat food & water is left throughout the park, and most if not all of the cats have been neutered.

A suprisingly popular and happy place in the middle of the city for the people of Lima, but in particular for Jacqui and I.
