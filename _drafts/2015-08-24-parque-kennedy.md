Kennedy Park in Lima is a truly amazing, yet unusual but still joyful park in the middle of Miraflores, a bustling part of Lima. It's fairly quiet, easy to get to and even has free Wi-Fi. But the reason everyone goes to Parque Kennedy is to see all the cats that live throughout this garden in the middle of the city.

It's not known how the cat's became to be in the park, but theres lots of stories or tales of how it all began. Cat food & water is left throughout the park, and most if not all of them have been neutered.
