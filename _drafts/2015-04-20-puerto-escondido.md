After our hike from La Neveria to Benito Juárez, another 4km walk to the road back to Oaxaca, an hour in the collectivo taxi and a 10 hour overnight bus, we arrived in Puerto Escondido on the Pacific coast of Mexico.

Top of the to-do list was relax and enjoy the warm humid temperatures after hiking in the mountains. The hostal we stayed at had three large mango trees that hurled mangoes on cars, the driveway, the grass and in the pool at all hours of the day.

Puerto Escondido has one of the best surf spots in all of Mexico and is ranked as one of the top 10 surf destinations worldwide at it's famous Playa Zicatela. Much too big to swim in without a surfboard. We settled for the Zicatela boardwalk.

Most days consisted of running down to the Playa Zicatela to get an  açai bowl for breakfast. Swimming and attempting to surf at the Playa Carrizalillo and relaxing by the pool. Very high humidity in Puerto was easily offset by many beverages. Being on the coast, Puerto Escondido has great seafood available and we attempted fish tacos.
