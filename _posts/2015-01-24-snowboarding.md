We timed our arrival to Sun Peaks two days too late. A 30 year record snowfall of 45cm fell in the space of a day and a half, but the snow has been great since then. With fresh snow falling every few days and we've been lucky to find nice powder stashes in the trees for us to play between. We've already found our favourite runs but the mountains are so big there is still so much to explore.
