Our time here in Sun Peaks has flown by with only 9 days left before we move on to our 2 week road trip around Alberta. It was only the other day we realised that we hadn't posted anything in over a month. I guess we have been busy making the most of our time here, as well as getting in as much snowboarding as possible before the season has an early finish. 

So this post is a snapshot of what we've been doing in Sun Peaks and the surrounding areas over the past month.

I guess the main thing we have been doing is snowboarding. Getting out there in all types of conditions (powder, ice, slush & groomers) and making the most of it. We've both improved a fair bit since being here and only wish the season went for longer & we had more of an opportunity to experience deep Canadian powder.

We have hiked up Gils a few times now, enjoying some coffee at 'Gil's espresso bar' and then finding some fresh snow through the trees.

We have been Snow shoeing, well I have while Simon worked. We walked out to a beautiful little cabin and had smokies (hot dogs),  cider and smores on the fire.

Cross Country skiing was a lot of fun and extremely funny to watch everyone, including myself, struggle to stay on our feet while going down some pretty steep terrain.

Over a few days when the snow wasn't the best Simon built a jump outside our house to use on our Sleds. That was alot of fun and amazingly we had no injuries considering how hard the snow was and how much air we sometimes got!

Last week we went to our first hockey match which was our local CHL team the Kamloops Blazers and the Calgary Hitmen. It was an under 21s game but still a lot of crashing and bashing and very fast paced. We are looking forward to seeing a NHL match in Calgary or Vancouver soon.

There has been plenty more happening here that photos just don't do justice for, but we have had a great time but look forward to our next adventure...
